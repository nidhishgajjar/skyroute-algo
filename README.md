# Skyroute

A program to help commuters get from one landmark to another. 

A routing tool that uses breadth-first search, depth-first search, and Python dictionaries to accomplish this feat. 

(For the purposes of this project, we can assume that it takes the same amount of time to get from each station to each of its connected neighboring stations.)
